modular-game-rules
==================

My master thesis' practical part. The thesis is about creating a new way of implementing game rules in a video game.
* Increasing the game's flexibility to better fit the Scrum development process
* Facilitating communication between programmers and designers
* Decreasing development time

This is accomplished by separating the game rule implementation from the concrete specification of the rules. The rules are modular and can be changed easily. They could be randomized, and tweaking could be automated. The rules can be changed at run-time.
